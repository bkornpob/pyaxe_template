# pyaxe_template
A template for pyaXe

- Example01: This template is modified from the original one provided with the old aXe version (see https://github.com/spacetelescope/aXe_Cookbook). It works with pyaxe version '0.1.dev29+gf57de55.d20200106', sextractor version 2.19.5 (2014-11-16), and pyaxehelper version 1.0.0 (see https://github.com/bkornpob/pyaXeHelper). Simply copy everything from the BACKUP_DATA/ to the root (i.e., same directory with the .ipynb file). 

- Example02: This reduces data downloaded from MAST archive (PID:14544, downloaded before 2020; Note: MAST data after 2020 have changed the structure which causes pyaxe to crash as discussed in [#7](https://github.com/spacetelescope/pyaxe/issues/7)). They are a subset of images of GD153 taken in G141/F160W pairs. It works with pyaxe version '0.1.dev29+gf57de55.d20200106', sextractor version 2.19.5 (2014-11-16), and pyaxehelper version 1.1.0 (see https://github.com/bkornpob/pyaXeHelper). Simply run the .ipynb file; it will take care all the copying from BACKUP_DATA/ to proper locations.
